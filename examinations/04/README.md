# Examination 4 - Install a Web Server

Now that we know how to install software on a machine through Ansible, we can
begin to look at how to set up a machine with services.

A typical use case is how to get a web server up and running, and coincidentally
we happen to have one of our hosts named `webserver`.

As in the previous examination, we can use the [ansible.builtin.package](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html)
module to install the prerequisite software.

Create a new file, you can call it what you like, but in the example below, it's referred to as
`webserver.yml`.

    ---
    - name: Install a webserver
      hosts: web
      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Ensure nginx is installed
          ansible.builtin.package:
            name: nginx
            state: latest

        - name: Ensure nginx is started at boot
          ansible.builtin.service:
            name: nginx
            enabled: true

The above is a playbook that will install [nginx](https://nginx.org/), a piece of software that can
act as a HTTP server, reverse proxy, content cache, load balancer, and more.

Now, we can run `curl` to see if web server does what we want it to (serve HTTP pages on TCP port 80):

    $ curl -v http://<IP ADDRESS OF THE WEBSERVER>

Change the text within '<' and '>' to the actual IP address of the web server. It may work with the
name of the server too, but this depends on how `libvirt` and DNS is set up on your machine.

Is the response what we expected?

    $ curl -v http://192.168.121.10
    *   Trying 192.168.121.10:80...
    * connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 from 192.168.121.1 port 46036 failed: Connection refused
    * Failed to connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 after 0 ms: Could not connect to server
    * closing connection #0
    curl: (7) Failed to connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 after 0 ms: Could not connect to server

# QUESTION A

Refer to the documentation for the [ansible.builtin.service](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/service_module.html)
module.

How can we make the web server start with an addition of just one line to the playbook above?

***Answer:*** Answer:
You can add the line:
```bash
state: started
```
under the ansible.builtin.service task.
enabled: true ensures nginx starts at boot.

state: started ensures the service starts immediately.

# QUESTION B

You make have noted that the `become: true` statement has moved from a specific task to the beginning
of the playbook, and is on the same indentation level as `tasks:`.

What does this accomplish?

***Answer:*** Placing become: true at the playbook level makes all tasks run with root privileges (sudo), so you don’t need to specify it for each individual task. 

This simplifies the playbook and ensures all commands that require administrative access can run successfully.

# QUESTION C

Copy the above playbook to a new playbook. Call it `04-uninstall-webserver.yml`.

Change the ordering of the two tasks. Make the web server stop, and disable it from starting at boot, and
make sure that `nginx` is uninstalled. Change the `name:` parameter of each task accordingly.

Run the new playbook, then make sure that the web server is not running (you can use `curl` for this), and
log in to the machine and make sure that there are no `nginx` processes running.

Why did we change the order of the tasks in the `04-uninstall-webserver.yml` playbook?

***Answer:***
We stop and disable the nginx service before uninstalling the package because if we remove the software first, the service cannot be stopped (it no longer exists).

Stopping it first avoids errors and ensures the system is cleanly shut down before removal.
# BONUS QUESTION

Consider the output from the tasks above, and what we were actually doing on the machine.

What is a good naming convention for tasks? (What SHOULD we write in the `name:` field`?)

***Answer:*** Task names should describe what the task does, not how it is implemented.

Example of good names:

“Install nginx”

“Start nginx service”

“Stop and disable nginx”

“Remove nginx package”

Avoid implementation details like “Run package module for nginx,” because names should be clear, readable, and understandable by anyone reading the playbook.
